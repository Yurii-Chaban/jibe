## Anagram Game - Question 2

This repository also contains an anagram game solution for Question 2. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Example: The word "listen" can be rearranged to form "silent" - they are anagrams of each other.

The anagram functionality is separate from the cricket team selection application.
